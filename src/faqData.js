    answer:
      "Web hosting allows businesses, organizations, and individuals to make their websites or apps visible on the internet. Whether they're using a dedicated server, or sharing resources, every website is hosted on a server. The only way for a website to be visible on the internet is if it's hosted by a web hosting service provider, also known as a web host. In order to find a website, you type the domain name (or URL) into your browser. Your computer will then connect to the server where the website is hosted, and the webpage is delivered onto your screen.",

    title: ' What Are the Different Types of Web Hosting Products HostIN Offers?',
    answer: `HostIN offers several different types of hosting plans that work for all website hosting needs.
  
 Shared hosting is the most affordable option, but it does have its limitations. Shared hosting customers share the server's resources with other customers. If another website on the same server is receiving large amounts of traffic, or using a lot of the server's limited resources, it's possible that your site may run slower as a result.

    title: ' How Do I Buy a Domain Name?',
    answer: `Buying a domain name with HostIN is simple and comes with features that a lot of other hosts don't offer.

    After buying your domain name with HostIN, you'll also receive:
    
    + Free WHOIS Privacy Protection (which keeps your website registration details private)
    + auto-renewals (so you don't have to worry about a lapse in ownership)
    + unlimited subdomains (like blog.yoursite.com, or mexico.yoursite.com, for example)
    + domain setting controls at your fingertips (like MX records, CNAME, etc.)

    title: '  How Do I Migrate Over to HostIN?',
    answer: `
If you want to move your web hosting to HostIN, the first step is to create a HostIN account – you can do that from any of our product pages (Shared Hosting, VPS, Dedicated, DreamPress) During the signup process, select the option to add your current domain to your new account – don't worry, this does NOT affect your current live website!

Next, you'll need to backup your website files and upload them to HostIN. You can learn more about this.

Once you've migrated your website to HostIN's servers, you'll need to check the site to confirm that it looks and functions just as intended. If everything looks great, you'll need to point your DNS to HostIN so people know where to find you! If this sounds complicated, don't worry. We have some documentation.

Have some questions before you get started? No worries. Get in touch with us and we'll be happy to help.`,
